```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code compiles and runs without errors, but it might not behave as expected if the input list contains elements that cannot be compared using the default `Ord` instance. For example:
```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

data = [1, 'a', 2]
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let ys = sort data
  print ys
```
This will result in a runtime error because `1` and `'a'` cannot be compared using the default `Ord` instance.
